Google Stock Price Prediction 
Project Overview
This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the future stock prices of Google based on historical data.

The goal is to showcase the application of deep learning techniques (RNN + LSTM) for time series forecasting in the financial domain.
